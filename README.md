# Adapting the Minecraft Recipe to be a Tie-A-Knot tutorial

This project is a fork of https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto which is a sample howto alexa skill.  I have changed the assets and intents to relate to the Boy Scouts of America Basic Knots, and plan to add a timer function.

The original README can be found in the alexa repo, along with the original guide.
