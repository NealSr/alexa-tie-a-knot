# Adapting the Minecraft Recipe to be a Tie-A-Knot tutorial

This project is a fork of https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-howto which is a sample howto alexa skill.  I have changed the assets and intents to relate to the Basic Knots you'd learn in Cub Scouts or Boy Scouts.

The original README can be found in the above alexa repo, along with the original guide.

To upload this to AWS / Alexa, edit as desired, package your dependencies, and upload as a zip file.

Sample terminal commands:
```
cd src
npm install
zip -r archive.zip .
```
