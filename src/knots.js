Ah, so it is possible to knot those two pieces. Not these pieces! Yes. Knot those pieces. Why not? Because it's all for naught! - from Winnie the Pooh - 2011. IMDb number tt1449283.",
        "overhand knot": "Tie an overhand knot by taking both ends of the rope in your hand, cross the right end over the left end to make a loop, and continue through the loop with the right end exiting to the left.  After making the basic knot, pull it tight on both ends.",
        "square knot": "Begin with an overhand knot, with the right end over the left end.  Next take the same end, now on the left, back over the right end and continue through the second loop.  After pulling the ends tight you should have two sides that are flat and even, with both sides forming a loop with the strings passing through together.",
        "granny knot": "A granny knot is similar to a square knot, but start on the same side for both loops. If you start with the right end for the overhand knot, use the new right end again for the second loop.  After pulling the ends tight the sides should have both sides forming a loop but with one string above the loop and one string below the loop.",
